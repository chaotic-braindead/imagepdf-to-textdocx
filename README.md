# imagepdf-to-textdocx
 
This script converts unselectable .pdf texts to .docx files. Maybe a program that does the same thing exists but idk.

The code still needs some optimization as I am still new to programming. I just quickly put this together at the request of my brother lmao


Note: Output text on .docx file is not formatted the same as the source .pdf. Maybe I'll do work on it when I can figure it out.
