This script converts unselectable .pdf texts to .docx files. Maybe a program that does the same thing exists but idk.

**Note:** Output text on .docx file is not formatted the same as the source .pdf. Images are also not transferred to the document.

Go easy on the code as I am still new to programming. I just quickly put this together at the request of my brother lmao.
